Please refer back on 2 excel generated by you named as 
phase1_all_batches_amended.xlsx
phase2_all_batches_amended.xlsx

Which contains worksheet for each Batches labeled to its corresponding batch like BATCH1, BATCH2, etc
etc
It contains last column with named as OPENREWRITE_RECIPE_YAML that contains the receipe provided by you.

Now please help to guide me by providing step by step guide to generate a wrapper Maven module named as migration_tool which contains structure as below
below
 1. My monolithic apps in exploded view and is non-maven mofule is named as fpms_module
2. My Maven based wrapper module is migration_tool
3. My project root is fpms_src_web_content

Structure is

fpms_src_web_content 
       fpms_module(non maven)
             src
              ls_web
       migration_tool
              support_excel 
(Now this folder suppot_excel will contain 2 excel provided by you phase1_all_batches_amended.xlsx and phase2_all_batches_amended.xlsx also will contains another excel named fpms_src_files_by_phase_batch.xlsx =it contains 3 columns PHASE, BATCH, FILEPATHNAME
Where it will contains all the src & ls_web impacted to be changed by phase & batch

Now help to guide to run each phase by it's batch number 

Where requirement is to pass phase & batch based on it will read the listed files in excel fpms_src_files_by_phase_batch and first it will copy those files based on input provided as phase & batch into a folder created inside fpms_module as PHASE1_BATCH1 copy here and then need to apply open rewrite receipe on those code in this newly created folder by reading the recepie founded in phase1_all_batches_amended.xlsx and phase2_all_batches_amended.xlsx

So later on can compile those files in jdk 8 and jdk 21. If complie ok then need to checkout from dimension using dmcli command for those listed folder in newly created folder PHASE1_BATCH1 but this checkout should be manual script during actual event to populate the folder but for now it should auto copy from fpms_module folder src and ls_web

Then I will validate by contacting a code review and code compiling successfully only then the dmcli script to check in the dimension where will provide inputs as iccf_number a reference which had been created by me manually

Hope you understood my requirements 

So I can run dry runs for each phase-batch in advance, validate the open rewrite able to capture my each planned phases changes then correct if necessary and reapply so as script is mature then will do run dmcli script to checkout run open rewrite and compile and verify then check in dimension via dncli script
